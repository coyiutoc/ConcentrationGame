# Concentration Game

Designed to act as a mood manipulation task for the Mechanisms of Affect & Dysregulation
Lab at Wellesley College, lead by Christen Deveney, Ph.D.

The application allows the researcher to input participant information such as
subject ID and number of trials.

The task involves avoiding all contact with moving shapes and the boundary of the
GUI for as long as possible. Every 5 seconds, the velocity of the shapes increases.

After all trials have been completed, the application provides simple statistics
on task performance, such as number of shape hits, border hits, and
highest score.
